# DS - directory sizes

I wanted a tool to show me the total size of the files in a directory. Seems simple doesn't it?

We the standard tool `du` will report the size of the directory but it includes the size of the subdirectories too. No way to stop it doing that. Also it can include the size of the directory table itself

It's my itch, this is how I will scratch it
